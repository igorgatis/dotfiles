This repo contains dotfiles for terminal tools such as bash, vim, git, etc.

It is managed using [yadm](https://yadm.io/) but it is not required. If you have `yadm` installed, you can run:
```sh
yadm clone git@github.com:igorgatis/dotfiles.git
```

For a yadm one-liner installer, run:
```sh
curl -Ssf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/igorgatis/dotfiles/main/.config/yadm/install.sh | sh
```
