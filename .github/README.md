This repo contains dotfiles for terminal tools such as bash, vim, git, etc.

It is managed using [yadm](https://yadm.io/) but it is not required.

Here is the command I use for my readonly access:
```sh
yadm clone https://github.com/igorgatis/dotfiles.git
```
Read-write access:
```sh
yadm clone git@github.com:igorgatis/dotfiles.git
```
